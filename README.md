ensimag-allocator
==================

These files implement a memory-allocator.
This project was an assignment for the course of "Operating System & Concurrent computing" at Ensimag ("SystÃ¨me d'Exploitation et Programmation Concurrente" in french).

All the files are covered by the licence GPLV3+

Introduction
----------

The goal of the course was to explore different ways to implement a physical memory allocation.
In this assignment, we implemented the Buddy algorithm (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_memory_allocation).
A modified version of this algorithm is also used in the Linux Kernel.

Usage
----------

> `cd ensimag-allocateur`

> `cd build`

> `cmake ..`

> `make`

> `make test`
